# SmartThings

This project consists of a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS. It runs HTTPD with index.php as the source. The PHP file can run a Python script in order to trigger the GPIO pins on the Pi. This causes a relay to momentarily turn on then off. I'm using this on a gate so the short/momentary capability was key.
